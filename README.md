# WeatherHub
WeatherHub is a project that collects weather from weather stations and displays this information via a JavaScript widget that can be embedded on any site. 

This projects main purpose it to satisfy the need of my local paragliding club, The Derbyshire Soaring Club, who wanted to collect the data from a Davis Instruments weather station, have this processed and then displayed on their website so pilots can view the weather on the hill. 

The project has been written in such a way that it should be able to be easilly extended in the future to include data from other weather stations and can collect, store and provide widgets for more than one weather station.
